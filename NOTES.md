# GitHub Repositories Collector - Program Design and Considerations

The GitHub Repositories Collector is designed to fetch and display GitHub repository information using the GitHub API. 
This document discusses the program design and considerations.

## Program Design

The program is organized into several key components:

- **`httpServer`**: Provides a web interface for users to search and view repository information. It utilizes the Gorilla Mux router for defining API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
- **`cacheDBs`**: Implements the caching mechanism using Redis. The `CacheDB` interface defines the contract for cache databases, and the `RedisDB` struct implements this interface using Redis as the cache database.
- **`repositoriesCollectors`**: Defines the repositories information collector. The `ReposCollector` interface specifies methods for configuring and setting up the collector, as well as handling API routes and fetching repository data.
- **`templates`**: Contains HTML templates for rendering repository information.
- **`utils`**: Provides utility functions for rendering HTML templates, formatting data, and managing pagination.

## Generalizing the Project

The project can be generalized to support different types of repository collectors, not limited to GitHub. This can be achieved by using interfaces and following good design principles.

- **`ReposCollector` Interface**: The `ReposCollector` interface abstracts the repositories information collector's behavior. By adhering to this interface, different collectors (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket) can be implemented to fetch repository data from various sources.

## Considerations

- **Caching**: The application employs caching to reduce the load on external APIs. The `CacheDB` interface and `RedisDB` implementation allow for easy integration of other caching mechanisms.
- **Pagination**: Pagination is implemented to display repositories efficiently. The `utils` package provides tools to calculate and manage pagination.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles errors gracefully by returning appropriate HTTP error responses when necessary.
- **Testing**: The `repositoriesCollector_tests` directory contains tests for the HTTP server functionality.
